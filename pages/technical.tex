\section{Technical Regulations}


\subsection{Positioning}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sets of markers of different sizes are positioned in the arena
	\item Each marker ID is associated with a set of information:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Length of the marker side
	\item X-positioning
	\item Y-positioning
	\item Z-positioning
	\item Roll angle
	\item Pitch angle
	\item Yaw angle
\end{itemize}

\item This information enables positioning in the arena with a view of a single marker
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Collision Prevention}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Each drone is recommended to be equipped with a spherical protection case to protect the drone and other drones from damage}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Emergency Shutoff and Kill Switch}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Each drone must be equipped with a physical or virtual kill switch.
	\item Activation of the kill switch results in immediate landing or motor Shutoff
	\item One button to land whole swarm
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Size and weight limits}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Below 25kg per drone}
	\item The drone swarm must consist of no more than 5 drones
	\item The drone swarm must consist of more that 2 drones.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Drone identification}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Each drone must be equipped with an RFID marker for identification by the target objects. The markers will be provided by brigkAIR at the event.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ground Control Station}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It is not required that the computing must be performed soley onboard.
	\item The bahavior of individual drones can be either controlled by a single agent, which is aware of the global state or by one agent per drone.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Arbiter / Judge}
No technical solution is provided by the organizers that collects and/or distributes (real-time) information on positioning, scoring and thus acts as a source of truth or a referee.
