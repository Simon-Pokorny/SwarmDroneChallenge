# Swarm Drone Challenge Rulebook

This repository contains a Latex project that contains the rules for the Swarm Drone Challenge. 
If you are a participant of the swarm drone challenge feel free to open issues to discuss questions or fork this repository and create a pull request with your proposed rule changes.
The document consists of a main file called  sdc_regulations.tex that references the files  `pages/technical.tex` and `pages/competition_outline.tex`.
